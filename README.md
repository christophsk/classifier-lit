# ðŸ”¥ `classifier-lit` The Language Interpretability Tool (LIT) for Text Classification

![](classifier_lit/static/demo.png)

This is an implementation of the
[Language Interpretability Tool](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/) for text classification.
This was assembled from examples in LIT as a way to
experiment with various features of LIT.

Contributions are welcome.

## Quickstart
Install the requirement
```
pip install -r requirements
```
and run the bash script
```bash
./run_demo.sh
```
The required `pytorch` model will be downloaded if it's not cached:
```

Starting Server on port 5432
You can navigate to 127.0.0.1:5432
```

Open LIT in your browser

## Model
A model name or path for a `transformers` SequenceClassification model. 
This can be a path to your (`pytorch`) trained model or the name an appropriate
model from [HuggingFace models](https://huggingface.co/models).

## Data
The data is a `.csv`,  ideally consisting of validation data, with one column
for the text and the other validation label. 

If the validation label is not known, use 0 (zero). 
The metrics will be meaningless, but all the other LIT features are
available.


## Using a GPU
A GPU is automatically detected and used.
If your GPU instance is a remote, headless cloud instance, you can still
use your local browser by using port forwarding feature of SSH. For port 5432:

```
ssh -i access-creds.pem -L 5432:localhost:5432 <your id>@<remote IP address>
```

Start the server on the remote and view the results in your local browser.

## Commandline Usage
```
usage: seq_server.py [-h] --model_path MODEL_PATH --data_path DATA_PATH
                     --label_text_cols LABEL_TEXT_COLS
                     [--batch_size BATCH_SIZE] [--max_seq_len MAX_SEQ_LEN]
                     [--port PORT]

Start the LIT server

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --model_path MODEL_PATH
                        tar.gz, name, or directory of the pytorch model
  --data_path DATA_PATH
                        path + file.csv, for the data .csv
  --label_text_cols LABEL_TEXT_COLS
                        python-style list of indexes [label-index, text-index]
                        in the .csv
  --batch_size BATCH_SIZE
                        batch size, default=8
  --max_seq_len MAX_SEQ_LEN
                        maximum sequence length up to 512, default=128
  --port PORT           LIT server port, default=5432
```
