## The Language Interpretability Tool (LIT) for Text Classification

This package provides an implementation of the PAIR code 
[Language Interpretability Tool](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/) for a sentence
classification. It builds off the various LIT examples to provide a convenient
way to run the LIT server.

## Requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model and Data
### Model
You're required to have a local `pytorch` SequenceClassification model you've trained on labels in
`range(num_labels)`. The model's directory should conform to the usual `pytorch` layout.

### Data
The data is a `.csv` ideally consisting of validation data, with columns
```
"src", "label", "sentence"
```
`src` is a user-specific identifier, `label` is the validation label, and `sentence` is the text to be classified.

If the validation label is not known, any value in `range(num_labels)` can be used (e.g., 0). 
The metrics will be meaningless, but all the other LIT features are
available.

## Starting the Server

The easiest way is to use bash script `clf_lit.sh`. 
The script takes three arguments, the `.csv` and the model directory:

```bash
./clf_lit.sh sentences.csv model_directory
```

The default content root is `$HOME/classifier-lit` and can be changed in the script as can
the other defaults (shown below).

Or,

```bash
python clf_lit.py \
    --data_path sentences.csv \
    --model_path model_directory \
    --num_labels 3 \
    --batch_size 8 \
    --max_seq_len 128 \
    --port 5432
```

After a short wait, you should see
```

### Running with a GPU
Inference on a even a moderate set of sentences can be computationally intensive and benefits from
GPU assistance. Typically, this is a remote, headless cloud instance. 

You can use your local browser by forwarding the port from the remote using SSH:

```
ssh -i access-creds.pem -L 5432:localhost:5432 <your id>@<remote IP address>
```

Start the server on the remote and view the results in your local browser.
