## The Language Interpretability Tool (LIT) for Text Classification

This app is an implementation of the
[Language Interpretability Tool](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/) for text classification.
This was assembled from examples in LIT to provide an easy-to-use way to
try various features of LIT.

Contributions are welcome.

## Requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model
A model name or path for a `transformers` SequenceClassification model. 
This can be a path to your (`pytorch`) trained model or the name an appropriate
model from [HuggingFace models](https://huggingface.co/models). You will need
to know the number of classification labels in your model.

### Data
The data is a `.csv`,  ideally consisting of validation data, with columns
```
"src", "label", "sentence"
```
`src` is a user-specific identifier, `label` is the validation label, and `sentence` is the text to be classified.
Modify `clf_dataset.py` as appropriate to conform to the expected format.

If the validation label is not known, use 0 (zero). 
The metrics will be meaningless, but all the other LIT features are
available.

## Starting the Server

The easiest way is to use bash script `clf_lit.sh`. 
The script takes two arguments, the data `.csv` and the model name or path:

```bash
./start_lit.sh text.csv model-name-or-path
```

The default content root is `$HOME/classifier-lit`. Update as required
for your environment.

```bash
python clf_lit.py \
    --data_path data.csv \
    --model_path model-name-or-path \
    --batch_size 8 \
    --max_seq_len 128 \
    --port 5432
```

After a short wait, you should see
```

## Notebook Example

## Using a GPU
A GPU is automatically detected and used.
If your GPU instance is a remote, headless cloud instance, you can still
use your local browser by using port forwarding feature of SSH. For port 5432:

```
ssh -i access-creds.pem -L 5432:localhost:5432 <your id>@<remote IP address>
```

Start the server on the remote and view the results in your local browser.

## Usage
```
usage: clf_server.py [-h] --model_path MODEL_PATH --data_path DATA_PATH 
                     [--label_text_cols LABEL_TEXT_COLS] 
                     [--batch_size BATCH_SIZE] [--max_seq_len MAX_SEQ_LEN]
                     [--port PORT] [--notebook] [--height HEIGHT]
